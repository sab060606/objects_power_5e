        Why do we value the objects we value? </h2>
      <p>Objects and Power examines the systems surrounding collections, investigating how history is told through the
        acquisition, presentation, and interpretation of art, artifacts, and texts. The ten artists in the exhibition
        address varied topics that speak to how objects relate to power, such as the roots of collecting and museums;
        instances of extraction, theft, and erasure; themes of Indigeneity, access, and ownership; and examples of
        artists and community groups telling stories and imbuing power to objects on their own terms. Museums,
        libraries, and archives are repositories of objects and information that tell narratives about human history.
        While these organizations carry a weight of authority regarding art, artifacts, and documents, institutions are
        not neutral; connections to wealth, conquest, and extraction are woven throughout their holdings and
        infrastructure. While many institutions are doing work to confront the complicated provenance within their
        collections, Objects and Power features contemporary artists who consider these problems in their work—either
        directly or by circumvention. Be it through unpacking and critiquing power structures or through material
        directly carrying power in resistance, Objects and Power connects the dots between the objects we care about and
        the “work” these objects are doing. </p>

  <!-- <h2>MOON FACED</h2>
  <p>
    In ancient Persian literature, ماه طلعت (Moon-faced) was a genderless adjective used to define beauty in both men and women. In contemporary Iran, it refers to the beauty of women only. Something similar happened, in the world of images, to the Qajar dynasty portrait paintings: the modernization of Iran, the influence of the European tradition of realistic painting, and the use of camera technology and therefore photography as a model, overshadowed and ended the queer representation of genders that historically characterized these paintings, largely known for their gender-undifferentiation. For her project, “ماه طلعت، Moon-faced,” Allahyari uses a carefully researched and chosen series of keywords with a multimodal AI model to generate a series of videos from the Qajar Dynasty painting archive (1786-1925). Through this collaboration, the machine program learns to paint new genderless portraits, in the effort to undo and repair a history of Westernization that ended the course of nonbinary gender representation in the Persian visual culture. The music in this video was composed by Mani Nilchiani.
