    <h2>CREDITS</h2>
    <p>Objects and Power reflects continued conversations, within and beyond the ICA at MECA&D, about the role of art institutions and their inherent responsibilities. Many artists, historians, arts administrators, faculty, students, and community members have shared forms of knowledge about how objects relate to power through their own work, shared conversation, and/or community action. Objects and Power is organized by Iris Williamson (Director of Exhibitions), Lyra Noumena ‘26 (Curatorial Intern), Sarah Sawtelle ‘19 (Exhibitions Coordinator), Caroline Kouba ‘22 (Exhibitions Assistant); with support and collaboration from freelance preparators and ICA Student Staff.  Thanks to MECA&D faculty collaborators including Rose Logie (Visiting Assistant Professor, Academic Studies), Benjamin Spalding MFA '17 (Assistant Professor of Sculpture & Foundation, Foundation Program Chair), sabine stxrm (Chair of Academic Studies and Associate Professor of Environmental Humanities), John Portlock (Assistant Professor of Liberal Arts and Chair of the Diversity Committee), Kyle Patnaude (Associate Professor, Metalsmithing & Jewelry) (among others); to MECA&D student collaborators including Francy HInds ‘25 and Casey Matȟó ‘25; and to the many MECA&D staff members for their support and contribution towards the exhibition. Many thanks to groups and individuals near and far for continuing to unpack histories and to complicate our relationship with art and objects.  Generous support for the exhibition was provided through the Jeremy Moser and Laura Kittle Fund.</p>
